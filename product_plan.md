## Product Plan

1. The problem -- busy pet owners (cats or small dogs) often have to rely on leaving a lot of food out for their pets, or counting on friends to stop by when they are out of town or working late. Additionally, tracking a pet's weight and health can difficult if they are extrememly fluffy. This product, a combination of hardware and software, takes care of two issues. A DIY remote controlled feeder allows you to feed your pet remotely, and keep track of how many feedings they have receieved. The web app provides the mechanism for remotely feeding.

2. Market Research
  - Other DIY feeders have been built; however, I have found none that successfully integrate with a web app that is freely available
  - There are commercial feeders and other trackers that can be purchased for your pet, which sometimes come with a web interface for managing the hardware
  - Highly rated programmable feeders cost ~$130, and users complain they are a pain to program.
  - Some feeders, cats can break into and get super fat.
  - Feeder that response to smartphone created with Indigogo, three person dev team, $150. It doesn't have browser support (only iOS), and complaints of it being unrealiable.
  - Have not seen a touch sensor feeder (which is my next idea should I finish the basic implementation)


3. User Personas
  - Main target users are busy pet owners who occasionally need to remotely care for their pet, and who are interested in more data to track food intake.- Not suitable for longterm care, but for unexpected events that might keep you from getting home to feed a pet, or the occasional night away.
  - The tracking ability is good for multi-person household with pets who are deceitful about how often they have been fed.
