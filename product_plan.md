## Product Plan

1. The problem -- busy pet owners (cats or small dogs) often have to rely on leaving a lot of food out for their pets, or counting on friends to stop by when they are out of town or working late. Additionally, tracking a pet's weight and health can difficult if they are extrememly fluffy. This product, a combination of hardware and software, takes care of two issues. A DIY remote controlled feeder allows you to feed your pet remotely, and keep track of how many feedings they have receieved. The web app provides the mechanism for remotely feeding.

2. Market Research
  _ Competition:
    - Programmable commercial feeders and other pet trackers can be purchased for pets. Very few come with a web or smartphone interface for managing the hardware.
    - A feeder that responds to smartphone requests was created with funding from Indigogo and a three person dev team, costs $150. It doesn't have browser support (only iOS), and complaints of it being unrealiable.
  - User Issues:
    - Highly rated programmable feeders cost ~$130, and users complain they are a pain to program. These usually do not have a web or phone component.
    - With many feeders, owners complain that their pets can break into them and the result is a super fat pet.
  - Differentiation:
    - Other DIY feeders have been built; however, I have found none that successfully integrate with a web app that is freely available
    - Have not seen a touch sensor feeder (which is my next idea should I finish the basic implementation)
    - Login via FB or Twitter may allow for social media posting, another feature I have not seen on the market.


3. User Personas
  - Main target users are busy pet owners who occasionally need to remotely care for their pet, or who are interested in tracking food intake/feedings.
  - Not suitable for longterm care, but for unexpected events that might keep you from getting home to feed a pet, or the occasional night away.
  - Pet owners wanting the ability to set timed feedings.
  - The feeding metrics are good for multi-person household with pets who are deceitful about how often they have been fed.
  - Possible extensions:
    - A webcam to both ensure food was dispensed, as well to remotely check in on a pet.
    - Touch sensor that allows pet to trigger food dispensor, with restrictions on how many per day.
